#the Role of Machine Learning in Decryption#
The goal in this project is that I just wanted to research what happens if we train a model with a dataset which contains some messages and their encryptions.
I wrote an algorithm in C which is too basic and simple for encryption but the real goal here is to see the efficiency of trained machine learning model.
The algorithm to encrypt the messages or data is convert all letters in aphabet to a number(which letter in alphabet). And encrypted message is equal to (number + 1)*(number -1).
You can simply research which letters or which words are mostly used and which numbers you most collected and after you did this, you can easily create a dataset by matching your values.
After you created the dataset, you can train your model and use it to predict other values you collected.
